# novision

I just made **novision* and it's a multi-dashboard manager designed specifically for Apple Vision Pro. Inspired by Notion, this project aims to leverage VisionOS to create an innovative and immersive management experience. While the current version (v0) functions as a task manager, future iterations (v1 and v2) will introduce advanced features to support administrators in managing health metric dashboards for multiple child users, potentially in the aviation industry or other sectors. Suggestions for further development are welcome!

## v0 Features

- **Task Management**: Organize your tasks into lists, track progress, and manage your to-dos seamlessly within an intuitive Vision Pro interface. Supports grouping by order of progress. 
- **Multi-Dashboard Support**: Create and switch between multiple dashboards to keep your tasks and projects organized.
- **VisionOS Integration**: Experience task management like never before with the immersive capabilities of Vision Pro.

## Future Development (v1)

The next version of novision will introduce advanced administrative features, allowing for the management of health metrics dashboards for multiple child users. This could be particularly useful in industries such as aviation, with datat being fetched from apple watch, thanks to the seamless Apple ecosystem.
